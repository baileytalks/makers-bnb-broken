As a User,
So that guests can find my property easily,
I would like to name my property

As a User,
So that guests can decide whether to book my property,
I would like to include a description

As a User,
So that guests can decide whether to book my property,
I would like to set the price per night

As a User,
So that guests can decide whether to book my property,
I would like to set its availability

As a user,
So that in future I can stay in my chosen property,
I need to make a booking request to hire that space on my required dates.

As a user,
So I can make sure my property is safe,
I need to approve or deny new booking requests.

As a user, 
So I can save time by not trying to book spaces that are not available,
I cannot book spaces where bookings have been confirmed for the dates I need.
